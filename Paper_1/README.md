# Paper 1

### Note:
We discussed three algorithms to compute the GCD of two non-negative integers m, n in chapter 1. The algorithms were (1) Euclidâ€™s algorithm, (2) Starting with n as the candidate for gcd and if it does not divide both numbers then reduce the candidate gcd by 1 in each iteration and (3) prime factorization and taking the common factors. This paper will explore the experimental results of running the three algorithms. <br>

Pollard's rho method is used for factorization. 
Instead of trial division, the Pollard Rho algorithm is a faster way to find factors of a number that are not the number itself or one. It is based on modular arithmetic randomness and when drawn,  shape pattern is formed. Random numbers are generated in a loop. The numbers eventually repeat because of mod n. <br>

### Files:
**Paper_1.cpp**     - This is where all the functions live <br>
**Paper_1.h**       - H file for Paper_1.cpp <br>
**Paper_1Test.cpp** - Test file. This is the file to run test and create data. <br>
                - It runs three tests. Test 1 runs a testing range of (100-200), Test 2 runs a testing range of (1000-2000), Test 3 runs a testing range of <br>
                  (10000-20000). It'll pick a random m for each test and n is always smaller than m. <br>
